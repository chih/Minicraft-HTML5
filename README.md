Minicraft HTML5
===============

**[Click here to play it](http://chih.github.io/Minicraft-HTML5/)**



HTML5 Port of Minicraft, ported by Chi Hoang (chi@chi.ca)

Minicraft was original created by Markus Persson (Notch)

Done via GWT (Google Web Toolkit) and the Canvas tag.

A HTML5 browser is required (Firefox, Chrome, Safari).  IE9 should likely work, I have not yet tested it.

Mobile browsers have a software gamepad at the bottom and the display is optimized for the mobile device.
This part has only tested on an iPhone 4S runing iOS 5 so far.  It is quite playable on that device.


Building
--------

Update build.properties, make sure gwt.home it is pointing to a valid install of [GWT 2.4.0](http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/)
Then, just run ant


God mode
